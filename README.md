# Sycamore Garden Blog - WIP

Sam Sycamore's developer blog, published at [https://blog.sycamore.garden](https://blog.sycamore.garden).

This project is a fork of [cassidoo/blahg](https://github.com/cassidoo/blahg).
It's a minimalist Astro-based blog that uses vanilla CSS for styles and Markdown for publishing.
I stripped out many of the bells and whistles (such as Tina CSS) as well as styles that make [the original blog](https://cassidoo.co/) uniquely Cassidy's.
My version is all about the typography, and I drew a lot of inspiration from [Danilo's portfolio site](https://daniloleal.co/) for that part.
